    "lyrics": "I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road\r\nSearchin' in the sun for another overload\r\nI hear you singin' in the wire, I can hear you through the whine\r\nAnd the Wichita Lineman is still on the line\r\nI know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain\n\nAnd if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain\n\nAnd I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time\n\nAnd the Wichita Lineman is still on the line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time\n\nAnd the Wichita Lineman is still on the line"
