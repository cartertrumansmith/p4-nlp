    "lyrics": "Galveston, oh Galveston, I still hear your sea winds blowin'\r\nI still see her dark eyes glowin'\r\nShe was 21 when I left Galveston\r\nGalveston, oh Galveston, I still hear your sea waves crashing\r\nWhile I watch the cannons flashing\n\nI clean my gun and dream of Galveston\n\n\n\nI still see her standing by the water\n\nStanding there lookin' out to sea\n\nAnd is she waiting there for me?\n\nOn the beach where we used to run\n\n\n\nGalveston, oh Galveston, I am so afraid of dying\n\nBefore I dry the tears she's crying\n\nBefore I watch your sea birds flying in the sun\n\nAt Galveston, at Galveston"
